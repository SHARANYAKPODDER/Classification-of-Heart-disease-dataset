# Classification-of-Heart-disease-dataset
In this course project I have done classification task on the heart dataset. I have done the data analysis and visualization. After splitting the dataset into train and test, I have trained the dataset using Logistic Regression, KNN and evaluated it with the test dataset. After predicting, the Logictic Regression is best performing model than KNN.
